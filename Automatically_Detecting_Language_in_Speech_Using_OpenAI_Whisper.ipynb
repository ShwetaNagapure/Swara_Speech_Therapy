        "\n",
        "In this tutorial, we'll learn how to automatically detect the language spoken in an audio file using OpenAI’s Whisper model. Whisper is a state-of-the-art speech-to-text model capable of transcribing audio in various languages and detecting which language is being spoken.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll walk through the entire process, from setting up a Google Colab environment, installing necessary dependencies, loading the Whisper model, and analyzing audio files for language detection.\n",
        "\n",

In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.
